/**
 * The purpose of this class is to return a value which is used to make the non-linear load
 * curve of the relic arm elbow (its load varies arm angle) be closer to a linear curve so that
 * PID control of the elbow motors will work more efficiently.
 *
 * This value will depend on the current angle of the arm
